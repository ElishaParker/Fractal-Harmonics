### Overview
Fractal Harmonics listens to live or streamed audio and manifests it as evolving fractal geometries in real time.  
It fuses the math of the Mandelbulb with the art of cymatics, creating living sculptures of sound.

### Features
- 🎧 Live audio input (voice, music, or file)
- 🔮 Real-time 3D fractals powered by GLSL & Three.js
- 🌀 Orbit camera controls for full immersion
- 🌈 Audio-reactive color and geometry morphing
- 💾 Runs entirely in the browser (via GitHub Pages)

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/fractal-harmonics.git
